# Roulette
Roulette is a gambling game with a ball and wheel. The wheel has numbers 0 (green), 00 (green) and 1-36 (red or black). The wheel is spun and ball tossed into the wheel. Eventually they both come to a stop and whatever ball the bin lands in you win or lose depending on your bets.

This was a really fun project for me and with the implementation of unit tests, it really helped me to write out the code for this project
